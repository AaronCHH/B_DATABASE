## 3.1 The Example Database


```python
# %load ch03/ch03.sql
create table episodes (
  id integer primary key,
  season int,
  name text );

create table foods(
  id integer primary key,
  type_id integer,
  name text );

create table food_types(
  id integer primary key,
  name text );

create table foods_episodes(
  food_id integer,
  episode_id integer );
```


```python
create table episodes ( id integer primary key, season int, name text );
create table foods( id integer primary key, type_id integer, name text );
create table food_types( id integer primary key, name text );
create table foods_episodes( food_id integer, episode_id integer );
```

### Installation


```python
sqlite3 foods.db < foods.sql
```

### Running the Examples


```python
sqlite3 foods.db < foods.sql
```


```python
.echo on .mode column .headers on .nullvalue NULL
```


```python
select *
from foods
where name='JujyFruit'
and type_id=9;
```


```python
select f.name name, types.name type
from foods f
inner join (
  select *
  from food_types
  where id=6) types
on f.type_id=types.id;
```

## 3.2 Syntax


```python
select burger
from kitchen
where patties=2
and toppings='jalopenos'
and condiment != 'mayo'
limit 1;
```

### Commands


```python
select id, name from foods;
insert into foods values (null, 'Whataburger');
delete from foods where id=413;
```

### Literals


```python
'Derry'
'Newman'
'DujyFruit'
```


```python
'Kenny''s chicken'
```


```python
3.142
6.0221415E23
```


```python
x'Ol'
X'Offf'
x'OFOEFF'
X'OfOeffab'
```

### Keywords and Identifiers


```python
SELECT * from foo;
SeLeCt * FrOm F00;
```

### Comments

Comments in SQLite are denoted by two consecutive hyphens (--),
which comment the remaining line, or by the multiline C-style notation (/* */),
which can span multiple lines. Hereâ€™s an example:
```sql
-- This is a comment on one line
/* This is a comment spanning
two lines */
```

## 3.3 Creating a Database

### Creating Tables


```python
create [temp] table table_name (column_definitions [, constraints]);
```


```python
create [temp|temporary] table ... ;
```


```python
create table contacts ( id integer primary key,
                       name text not null collate nocase,
                       phone text not null default 'UNKNOWN',
                       unique (name,phone) );
```

### Altering Tables


```python
alter table table { rename to name | add column column_def }
```


```python
alter table contacts
        add column email text not null default '' collate nocase;
```


```python
.schema contacts
```


```python
create table contacts ( id integer primary key,
                        name text not null collate nocase,
                        phone text not null default 'UNKNOWN',
                        email text not null default '' collate nocase,
                        unique (name,phone) );
```

## 3.4 Querying the Database

### Relational Operations

### Select and the Operational Pipeline


```python
select [distinct] heading
from tables
where predicate
group by columns
having predicate
order by columns
limit count, offset;
```


```python
select heading from tables where predicate;
```


```python
sqlite> select id, name from foodjtypes;
```


```python
select * from foodjtypes;
```

### Filtering


```python
select * from dogs where color='purple' and grin='toothy';
```


```python

```

* Values

* Operators


```python
x = count(episodes.name) y = count(foods.name) z = y/x * 11
```

* Binary Operators


```python
x>5
1<2
```


```python
sqlite> SELECT l>2;
l>2
```


```python
sqlite> SELECT l<2;
l<2
```


```python
sqlite> SELECT 1=2;
1=2
```


```python
sqlite> SELECT -1 AND l;
-1 AND 1 1
```

* Logical Operators


```python
(x > 5) AND (x != 3)
(y < 2) OR (y > 4) AND NOT (y = 0)
(color='purple') AND (grin='toothy')
```


```python
sqlite> select * from foods where name='3ujyFruit' and type_id=9;
```

* The LIKE and GLOB Operators


```python
select id, name from foods where name like 'J%';
```


```python
select id, name from foods where name like '%ac%P%';
```


```python
select id, name from foods
        where name like '%ac%P%' and name not like '%Sch%'
```


```python
sqlite> select id, name from foods
...> where name glob 'Pine*';
```

### Limiting and Ordering


```python
select * from food_types order by id limit 1 offset 1;
```


```python
select * from foods where name like 'B%'
        order by type_id desc, name limit 10;
```


```python
select * from foods where name like 'B%'
order by type_id desc, name limit 1 offset 2;
```


```python
select * from foods where name like 'B%'
        order by type_id desc, name limit 2,1;
```

### Functions and Aggregates


```python
select upper('hello newman'), length('hello newman'), abs(-12);
```


```python
select id, upper(name), length(name) from foods
        where type_id=1 limit 10;
```


```python
select id, upper(name), length(name) from foods
        where length(name) < 5 limit 5;
```


```python
select count(*) from foods where type_id=1;
```


```python
select avg(length(name)) from foods;
```


```python
select type_id from foods group by type_id;
```

### Grouping


```python
select type_id, count(*) from foods group by type_id;
```


```python
select type_id, count(*) from foods
        group by type_id having count(*) < 20;
```


```python
select type_id, count(*) from foods;
```

### Removing Duplicates


```python
select distinct type_id from foods;
```


```python
select foods.name, food_types.name
        from foods, food_types
        where foods.type_id=food_types.id limit 10;
```

* Inner Joins


```python
Select *
From foods inner join food_types on foods.id = food_types.id;
```

* Cross Joins


```python
select * from foods, food_types;
```

* Outer Joins


```python
select *
from foods left outer join foods_episodes on foods.id=foods_episodes.food_id;
```

* Natural Joins

* Preferred Syntax


```python
select * from foods, food_types where foods.id=food_types.food_id;
```


```python
select * from foods inner join food_types on foods.id=food_types.food_id;
select * from foods left outer join food_types on foods.id=food_types.food_id;
select * from foods cross join food_types;
```

### Names and Aliases


```python
select foods.name, food_types.name
from foods, food_types
where foods.type_id = food_types.id
limit 10;
```


```python
select f.name, t.name
from foods f, food_types t
where f.type_id = t.id
limit 10;
```


```python
select f.name as food, e1.name, e1.season, e2.name, e2.season
from episodes e1, foods_episodes fe1, foods f,
     episodes e2, foods_episodes fe2
where
  -- Get foods in season 4
  (e1.id = fe1.episode_id and e1.season = 4) and fe1.food_id = f.id
  -- Link foods with all other epsisodes
  and (fe1.food_id = fe2.food_id)
  -- Link with their respective episodes and filter out e1's season
  and (fe2.episode_id = e2.id AND e2.season != e1.season)
order by f.name;
```

### Subqueries


```python
sqlite> select 1 in (l,2,3);
```


```python
sqlite> select 2 in (3,4,5);
```


```python
sqlite> select count(*)
...> from foods
...> where type_id in (l,2);
```


```python
select count(*)
from foods
where type_id in
 (select id
  from food_types
  where name='Bakery' or name='Cereal');
```

### Compound Queries


```python
select * from foods f
order by (select count(type_id)
from foods where type_id=f.type_id) desc;
```


```python
select f.name, types.name from foods f
inner join (select * from food_types where id=6) types
on f.type_id=types.id;
```


```python
select f.*, top_foods.count from foods f
inner join
  (select food_id, count(food_id) as count from foods_episodes
     group by food_id
     order by count(food_id) desc limit 1) top_foods
  on f.id=top_foods.food_id
union
select f.*, bottom_foods.count from foods f
inner join
  (select food_id, count(food_id) as count from foods_episodes
     group by food_id
     order by count(food_id) limit 1) bottom_foods
  on f.id=bottom_foods.food_id
order by top_foods.count desc;
```


```python
select f.* from foods f
inner join
  (select food_id, count(food_id) as count
     from foods_episodes
     group by food_id
     order by count(food_id) desc limit 10) top_foods
  on f.id=top_foods.food_id
intersect
select f.* from foods f
  inner join foods_episodes fe on f.id = fe.food_id
  inner join episodes e on fe.episode_id = e.id
  where e.season between 3 and 5
order by f.name;
```


```python
select f.* from foods f
inner join
  (select food_id, count(food_id) as count from foods_episodes
     group by food_id
     order by count(food_id) desc limit 10) top_foods
  on f.id=top_foods.food_id
except
select f.* from foods f
  inner join foods_episodes fe on f.id = fe.food_id
  inner join episodes e on fe.episode_id = e.id
  where e.season between 3 and 5
order by f.name;
```

### Conditional Results


```python
select name || case type_id
                 when 7  then ' is a drink'
                 when 8  then ' is a fruit'
                 when 9  then ' is junkfood'
                 when 13 then ' is seafood'
                 else null
               end description
from foods
where description is not null
order by name
limit 10;
```


```python
case
    when count(*) > 4 then 'Very High'
    when count(*) = 4 then 'High'
    when count(*) in (2,3) then 'Moderate'
    else 'Low'
end
```


```python
select name,( select
                case
                    when count(*) > 4 then 'Very High'
                    when count(*) = 4 then 'High'
                    when count(*) in (2,3) then 'Moderate'
                    else 'Low'
                end
            )
            from foods_episodes
            where food_id=f.id) frequency
from foods f
where frequency like '%High';

### Joining Tables
```

### Handling Null in SQLite


```python
select *
from mytable
where myvalue = null;
```


```python
sqlite> select NULL is NULL;
```


```python
sqlite> select nullif(l,l); null
sqlite> select nullif(l,2);
```

### Summary

Congratulations, youhave learned the select command for SQLiteâ€™s implementation of SQL.
Not only have you learned how the command works, but youâ€™ve learned some relational theory in the process.
You should now be comfortable with using select statements to queryyour data, join, aggregate, summarize, and dissect it for various uses.
Weâ€™ll continue the discussion of SQL in the next chapter, where weâ€™ll build on your knowledge of select by introducing the other members of DML, as well as DDL and other helpful SQL constructs in SQLite.
